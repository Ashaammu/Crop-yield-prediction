CROP YIELD PREDICTION USING DEEP LEARNING 


Predicting finger millet yield based on the area on which the crop yield depends so that it produces a better accuracy model and optimizes the yield prediction.Some of the Deep learning Models are implemented such as : Convolutional neural network(CNN), Transfer learning, Active learning.The proposed model implementation comprises of collecting the data from numerous sources and create dataset. After dataset creation, splitting the dataset into 2 parts i.e. training and testing dataset.Once model implementation is done, we will be comparing these models for prediction. Then by considering Active learning as best model for yield Prediction. Finally,crop yield is predicted based on the area.
